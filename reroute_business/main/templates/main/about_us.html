      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p class="about-hero-text">
        At ReRoute, we're driven to reduce recidivism by creating real, lasting pathways to fair-chance employment, personal confidence, and 
        meaningful community contribution. We recognize that the transition from incarceration to freedom is more than a legal 
        release - it's a personal rebirth.
        <br><br>
        Through access to practical skill development, mental health support, mentorship, supportyive resources, and job-ready tools, we aim to empower individuals not just to reenter society - but to lead in it.
        <br><br>
        We believe everyone deserves more than a second chance. They deserve a real shot at a future they can be proud of.

        ReRoute is led by a small, mission-locked founding team combining product, brand, and operational leadership. We are working 
        alongside community partners and reentry organizations to build a platform that treats people with dignity, moves deliberately, 
        and keeps opportunity at the center of every decision.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      ReRoute began with a simple belief: people returning from incarceration deserve more than judgment - they deserve opportunity. Our team is building
      the platform in close collaboration with community partners in Philadelphia and New Jersey, shaped by what people actually need to restart their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are early in the journey, and we are serious about getting it right. With each pilot, each resume built, and each partnership formed, we are laying the
      foundation for a trusted pathway to dignity, work, and long-term stability.
