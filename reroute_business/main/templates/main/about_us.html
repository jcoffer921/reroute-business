      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p class="about-hero-text">
        At ReRoute, we're driven to reduce recidivism by building real, lasting pathways to careers in tech, personal confidence, and community contribution.
        We recognize that the transition from incarceration to freedom is more than a legal release — it's a personal rebirth.
        <br><br>
        Through access to hands-on training, mental health support, mentorship, and job-ready tools, we aim to empower individuals not just to reenter society — but to lead in it.
        <br><br>
        We believe everyone deserves more than a second chance. They deserve a real shot at a future they can be proud of.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      ReRoute began with a simple belief: people returning from incarceration deserve more than judgment — they deserve opportunity. Our team is building
      the platform in close collaboration with community partners in Philadelphia and New Jersey, shaped by what people actually need to restart their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are early in the journey, and we are serious about getting it right. With each pilot, each resume built, and each partnership formed, we are laying the
      foundation for a trusted pathway to dignity, work, and long-term stability.
