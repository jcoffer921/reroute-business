    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      ReRoute began with a simple yet urgent belief: people returning from incarceration deserve more than judgment — they deserve opportunity. Rooted in the communities of Philadelphia 
      and New Jersey, our team has witnessed firsthand how systemic gaps impact those trying to rebuild their lives. We refuse to stand by while thousands face these challenges every 
      day. ReRoute exists to dismantle the stigma surrounding reentry by building a bridge back to dignity, opportunity, and long-term success.
    </p>
    <p>
      What started as a daydream has grown into a platform helping dozens of users craft resumes, apply to jobs, and reclaim their voice — and this is just the beginning.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="mission-text">
      At ReRoute, we're driven to reduce recidivism by building real, lasting pathways to careers in tech, personal confidence, and community contribution. 
      We recognize that the transition from incarceration to freedom is more than a legal release — it's a personal rebirth.  
      <br><br>
      Through access to hands-on training, mental health support, mentorship, and job-ready tools, we aim to empower individuals not just to reenter society — but to lead in it.  
      <br><br>
      We believe everyone deserves more than a second chance. They deserve a real shot at a future they can be proud of.
