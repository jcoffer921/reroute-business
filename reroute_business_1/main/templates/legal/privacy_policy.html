    </p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for

    <!-- Controls for Do-Not-Track Features -->
    <h2 id="controls-do-not-track">Controls For Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference 
      not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been 
      finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard 
      for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
